## AstroGAN
AstroGAN is a plugin that can automatically generate and classify images for various astronomical objects and phenomena. It uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) model to create realistic and high-quality images from scratch based on a text prompt or a voice command. It also uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify the generated images according to various criteria, such as type, size, distance, etc. It displays the generated image and the classification results in a user-friendly interface, and allows the user to save, share, or print the image.

## Installation
To install and run AstroGAN on the local server, you need to have the following requirements:

Python 3.9 or higher
TensorFlow 2.6 or higher
Keras 2.6 or higher
OpenAI 0.11 or higher
Flask 2.0 or higher
SpeechRecognition 3.8 or higher
An OpenAI API key
# You can install the required libraries and modules using the pip command:

pip install tensorflow keras openai flask speechrecognition

# You also need to set up the environment and the dependencies for the project, such as the GAN model name, the CNN model name, the image size, quality, and format, the data folder, and the files. You can find these settings in the main.py file, and you can modify them according to your preferences.

To run AstroGAN on the local server, you need to execute the main.py file using the python command:

python main.py

# This will start the Flask app on the local server, and you can access the plugin on your web browser by entering the URL:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## Usage
To use AstroGAN, you can enter a text query or a voice command, or upload an image file, and get the output image and the classification results.

To enter a text query, you can type the name or the description of the astronomical object or phenomenon that you want to see in the text box, and click on the “Generate” button. For example, you can enter “a spiral galaxy with a supermassive black hole at the center”, or “a supernova explosion”.
To enter a voice command, you can click on the “Record” button, and speak the name or the description of the astronomical object or phenomenon that you want to see. You can then click on the “Stop” button, and the voice command will be converted to a text query. For example, you can say “a binary star system with a red giant and a white dwarf”, or “a gamma-ray burst caused by a neutron star merger”.
To upload an image file, you can click on the “Choose File” button, and select an image file from your device. The image file should be in PNG format, and should not exceed 16 MB in size. For example, you can upload an image of a planet, a star, a galaxy, a nebula, etc.

# After entering the input, AstroGAN will generate an image that shows the astronomical object or phenomenon, and classify the image according to various criteria, such as type, size, distance, etc. It will also display the image and the classification results on the web page, and provide the sources for the classification results. You can also save, share, or print the image by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
